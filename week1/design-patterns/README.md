# Java Design Patterns â€“ Hands-on Practice

This folder contains Java implementations of the most common and important design patterns across **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** categories. Each pattern is organized in its own folder with:

- âœ… Clean and commented Java code
- ðŸ“˜ A `README.md` explaining intent, use cases, characteristics, and structure

## ðŸ“š Design Patterns Overview

| Pattern        | Type         | Description |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Singleton**  | Creational   | Ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides global access to it. |
| **Factory**    | Creational   | Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client. |
| **Builder**    | Creational   | Allows building complex objects step-by-step, ideal for immutable or configurable objects. |
| **Adapter**    | Structural   | Connects incompatible interfaces using a wrapper or adapter class. |
| **Decorator**  | Structural   | Dynamically adds behavior to objects by wrapping them in decorator classes. |
| **Proxy**      | Structural   | Provides a surrogate or placeholder to control access to another object. |
| **Strategy**   | Behavioral   | Enables selection of an algorithm at runtime from a family of interchangeable algorithms. |
| **Observer**   | Behavioral   | One-to-many dependency where all observers are notified when a subject changes state. |
| **Command**    | Behavioral   | Encapsulates a request as an object to parameterize clients and enable undo/redo functionality. |
